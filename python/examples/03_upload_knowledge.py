"""Knowledge — ingest a document then search it back.

Demonstrates the full ingest → search round-trip on a Nova OS
knowledge collection. Useful as a smoke test that retrieval is wired
correctly end-to-end before pointing real agents at the corpus.

Knowledge collections are scoped via the partner's API-key auth —
``c.knowledge.search(...)`` defaults to the caller's own collection
when ``collection`` is unset. Pass ``collection="shared"`` (or
whatever name your tenant has provisioned) to scope explicitly.

Prerequisites::

    pip install nova-os-sdk
    export NOVA_OS_URL=https://nova.your-company.example
    export NOVA_OS_API_KEY=msk_live_...

Run::

    python 03_upload_knowledge.py
