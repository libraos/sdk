"""FastAPI integration for WebhookRouter.

Lazy import — fastapi is NOT a runtime dep of nova-os-sdk. Only loads
when partner code calls `router.fastapi_router()`.

Note: `from __future__ import annotations` is intentionally omitted here.
FastAPI resolves route-handler annotations via `typing.get_type_hints()` at
registration time. When PEP 563 (stringified annotations) is active AND the
annotated type is imported inside the factory function (not at module level),
FastAPI cannot resolve the string back to the class — it raises 422. Keeping
annotations evaluated (no `__future__` import) and importing `Request` at the
top of `build_router` (where it IS in scope for `get_type_hints`) solves this.
