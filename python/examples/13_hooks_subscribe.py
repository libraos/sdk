"""Hooks — subscribe to lifecycle events.

Demonstrates partner registration of webhook subscriptions for the 9
canonical LibraOS lifecycle events.

**Important: as of v0.1.5 the registry is in-memory and the runtime
hook bus does not yet read from it.** Subscriptions are stored and
returned in list/get, but events do not yet fire to the registered
URLs. Persistence + bus bridge are tracked follow-ups. The wire
format on this surface is stable; partner integration code wired
against it today will start receiving deliveries once the bridge
ships — no SDK change required.

The 9 events:

  SessionStart      — opens a new conversation/session
  SessionEnd        — session closed (timeout or explicit close)
  UserPromptSubmit  — partner end-user submits a turn
  PreToolUse        — agent is about to invoke a tool
  PostToolUse       — tool call completed (success or error)
  PreInference      — agent is about to call the LLM
  PostInference     — LLM response received
  Stop              — agent decided to stop the run
  Error             — runtime error during the agent loop
