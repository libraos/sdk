"""Personas resource — /agents/v1/personas (#187 server / nova-os-sdk#14).

Boot-time persona discovery — partners cache the manifest by
``manifest_version`` and use ``If-None-Match`` to skip the body when
unchanged. Stops partners from mirroring nova-os YAML in their own
code: every persona's resolved triage mode + emitted route-hint kinds
+ route-template names are exposed in one envelope.

Path note: this resource lives under ``/agents/v1/...``, not the
``/v1/managed/...`` partner prefix used by the wrappers. That's the
existing legacy mount for the personas runtime; partners hit the same
URL the dashboard does.
